# Farcaster Bot Accounts
A public repository with Farcaster accounts considered to be bot accounts. You can find the list in the json file [here](https://github.com/Airstack-xyz/farcaster-bots/blob/main/farcaster-bots.json).

At the moment, we are manually scanning the top FIDs with the most number of replies & FIDs, reviewing those with the highest Social Capital Score (>1), and checking if those accounts are bot accounts (automatic replies, etc.). See example gdoc analysis [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FRvE2WbeqCWX3D0OjljYE7RzuIGmeynk6AfFeOwWbDM/edit?usp=sharing).

These bot accounts are excluded from Airstack Social Capital calculations.

Feel free to raise a PR to add more accounts to track overall bot activity on Farcaster, or ask to be included as a contributor.
