# Farcaster Bots
A public repository with Farcaster accounts Airstack is considering to be bot accounts. You can find the list in the json file [here](https://github.com/Airstack-xyz/farcaster-bots/blob/main/farcaster-bots.json).

At the moment, we are manully scanning the top FIDs with the most number of replies & FIDs with the highest Social Capital Score (>1), and checking if those accounts are bot accounts (automatic replies, etc.).

These accounts will be removed from the Social Capital Value calculations on Airstack to prevent boosting the value with actually adding any value to the content.

Feel free to raise a PR to add more accounts to track overall bot activity on Farcaster.
